This repository contains my personal cv as markdown. It can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ckanz/cv/blob/master/cv.md).

The markdown can be converted to html and pdf running ```bash export.sh```. The script produces an html file in the ```exports``` folder and requires [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).
