# Life Career - Clemens Anzmann

## Personal Details
I'm a software developer who loves to create products that help people explore exciting data. My educational background is in digital media, which I studied at the [Cork Institue of Technolgy](http://www.cit.ie/) and [Hochschule Darmstadt](https://www.h-da.de/). My master thesis was on data sonfication in the workplace, which I researched a London-based startup. After receiving my degree, I stayed with the startup company and began my journey as a software developer with a passion for data. I am now working for [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) on the graph visualisation application [Bloom](https://neo4j.com/bloom/). When I'm not writing code, I enjoy making music and photography.
