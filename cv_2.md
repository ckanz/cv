# Life Career - Clemens Anzmann

## Personal Details
I love code and data and enjoy creating meaningful data visualisations for the web. I was born and raised in [Aschaffenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aschaffenburg), later visited the bachelor course for multimedia in Ireland at the [CIT](http://www.cit.ie/) and received my master degree in Media Direction at the [Hochschule Darmstadt](https://www.h-da.de/) in Germany. My master thesis was on data sonfication in the workplace, which I wrote at the London data startup DataShaka. Now I'm working as a data visualisation engineer in London. When I'm not working with data, I enjoy making music and photography.
